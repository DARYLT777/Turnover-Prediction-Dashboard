# AI-Enabled Predictive Turnover Dashboard (MVP)

This repository contains a small, working prototype of an AI-enabled predictive turnover dashboard
for **IOP 563 — AI in I-O Psychology (Milestone 3)**.

The app is built with **Streamlit + Python** and uses **synthetic data** to simulate a mid-sized
hospitality organization (hotels, food & beverage, spa).

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone this repo.
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run main.py
